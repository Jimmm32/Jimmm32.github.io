                                Electric Blue Enhanced Flowers are a type of spray flower in the Pompom family that have
                                a blue tint. They are not naturally occurring blue roses, but rather flowers that have
                                been genetically modified or dyed to appear blue.

                                The search results indicate that true blue roses do not exist naturally due to genetic
                                limitations of rose plants.

                                Scientists have attempted to create blue roses through genetic modification, such as by
                                using bacterial enzymes to convert a rose petal compound into a blue pigment. However,
                                these efforts have not resulted in permanently blue roses.

                                The search results do not provide any specific information about a product called
                                'ElectricBlueRoses'. The closest match is the 'Electric Blue Enhanced Flowers' sold by
                                FiftyFlowers, which are spray flowers artificially colored blue, not true blue roses.

                                In summary, while blue-tinted flowers can be produced, naturally occurring blue roses do
                                not exist. The search results do not contain any information about a product called
                                'ElectricBlueRoses'.
